                    Life would be simply meaningless without you. Thank you for
                    being my girlfriend. Happy Valentine’s day, love. I may get
                    tired of breathing someday but I’ll never get tired of
                    loving you. Life is nothing without loving you. Happy
                    Valentine Day!
                </p>

                    I totally understand that the distance between us is just a
                    silly number and that it is just a temporary thing. I don’t
                    even want you to drop everything and materialize beside me -
                    but part of me wishes you could. It is probably very selfish
                    of me to wish for something like that, and I feel silly for
                    doing so. But there is this teeny-tiny part of me that wants
                    to able to celebrate ‘The Day Of Love‘ with you.
                </p>

                    I tried so hard to pass it off as just another day in the
                    calendar. But I could not. The truth is that I miss you and
                    I am waiting for the day I’ll get to see you and tell you
                    how much I love you, in person! Until then, I guess I’ll
                    just have to be patient - which I will be.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, Happy Valentine’s Day, girlfriend
                    dearest. I love you so much, and you know that. I miss you
                    and I’m hoping you get back soon. There are walks and dates
                    to go on, lots of silly things to be done, conversations
                    about everything under the sun to be had. Can’t wait.
                </p>
